Requires [SASS][] for compiling CSS.

Do not edit stylesheets in public/stylesheets/ directly. They are compiled from
SCSS to CSS, so all changes should be made instead to SCSS source files.

To compile, run:

    sass --watch sass:public/stylesheets

This will watch for any changes to files in the sass/ directory, automatically
recompiling to CSS and outputing to the public/stylesheets directory.
